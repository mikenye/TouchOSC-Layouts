# TouchOSC-Layouts

This project is a repository of [TouchOSC](https://hexler.net/software/touchosc) layouts that I use when producing audio dramas and podcasts for [Hail and Well Met!](https://hailandwellmetpodcast.com)

There are the following layouts available:

## Thrill (Basic)

[Thrill](http://www.galaxy-instruments.com/thrill.html) is an amazing "performance instrument for playing spine-chilling atmospheres, clusters, and hybrid textures" by [Native Instruments](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/cinematic/thrill/) / [Galaxy Instruments](http://www.galaxy-instruments.com/thrill.html).

This basic layout allows you to:
* Perform real-time control of Thrill's XY pad
* Perform simple note-on/note-off
* Play Thrill "live" (useful for stage performances)


## Edward Foleyart Instrument

[Edward Foleyart Instrument](https://tovusound.com/shop/edward-foley-artist-instrument/) "brings real recorded and natural randomized Foley Artist footsteps to every audio production studio: offers high end quality and parameters to adjust distance and environment based on Native Instruments Kontakt engine."

Also works perfectly with the [Real Outdoor Footsteps](https://tovusound.com/shop/real-outdoor-footsteps-efi/) expansion.

This layout allows you to:
* Play footsteps
* Control volume, pitch, shoe type and surface type (requires learning MIDI CC Automation in Kontakt)
